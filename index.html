            <h1>Hi, I'm Sarah.</h1>
            <p>
            The best part of being a creator is touching as many lives as possible with a design. Simply put, that is my goal: creating to help people. <br><br>

            As I pursue my undergraduate education, I intend to develop my perspective as a designer to best portray empathy, originality, and eloquence through what I create. After graduation, I aspire to be a User Experience or User Interface Designer. My perennial goal as a creative professional is to be known in the industry not necessarily for what I have designed, but for those I have helped. <br><br>

            Creativity can change the world.

            <h2>Special Thanks</h2>
            <p>
            A thank you is due to so many important people in my life. That being said, thank you to... <br><br>
                
            - My mom and dad, John and Suzanne <br>
            - My sister, Hannah <br>
            - My grandparents, Fred, Janet, Alex, and Linda <br>
            - My best friend, Sonja <br>
            - My roommate, Lana <br>
            - My very wonderful professors at UF <br>
            - The people I have met through my college ministry, Salt Company <br>
            - And all the friends I have made along the way <br> <br>
                
            Without the encouragement, help, and motivation from all of these people, I definitely would not be where I am today. I am so grateful to have such a wonderful team of people ready to help me at any minute I may need it. Here's to two more years of education!
